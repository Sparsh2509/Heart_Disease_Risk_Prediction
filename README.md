# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning-powered web API using FastAPI to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health indicators and medical history.
 This project is based on the dataset by kaggle [Heart Disease Cleveland UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci?resource=download).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts final student grade on a 0–20 scale.
- Organized input via four intuitive sections:
  - Student Details
  - Family Background
  - Academic Status
  - Health Status
- Categorical label encoding with automatic casing normalization.
- Grading remark generation (A+, B, C, etc.).
- Easy Flutter/mobile app integration.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.9.5

### Setup:
```bash
# Repository Name
Student_Performance_Prediction

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate 

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training

To train or retrain the model using the dataset:

```bash
python Student_Performance_model.py
```

This will generate the model and encoder files:
- `student_performance_model.joblib`
- `label_encoders.joblib`

---

## 🚦 Running the API

Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Navigate to:
- Swagger Docs: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- Root: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
