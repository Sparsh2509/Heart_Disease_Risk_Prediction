# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning-powered web API using FastAPI to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health indicators and medical history.
 This project is based on the dataset by kaggle [Heart Disease Cleveland UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci?resource=download).

 ### Deployed Model Using Streamlit

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts **presence or absence of heart disease** (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)
- Uses a hybrid system:
  - 🎯 Machine Learning (Random Forest) — provides probability-based prediction
  - 🩺 Rule-Based Scoring — evaluates each input against known medical thresholds

- Organized input via five intuitive medical sections:
  - **Demographic Information** – age, sex
  - **Chest Pain & Vitals** – chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol
  - **Blood & Sugar Data** – fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate
  - **ECG & Exercise Information** – resting ECG results, exercise-induced angina, ST depression
  - **Scan & Diagnostic Results** – number of major vessels colored, thalassemia type

## 🧠 Machine Learning Prediction (Random Forest Classifier)

- Predicts the probability of having heart disease using a trained Random Forest model.
- Outputs two probabilities:
  - Heart Disease Probability (%)
  - No Disease Probability (%)
- Generates clear, human-readable messages:
  - 🟢 Low risk → "Low risk — your heart health seems good"
  - 🟡 Moderate risk → "Moderate risk — maintain a healthy lifestyle"
  - 🔴 High risk → "High risk — please consult a cardiologist immediately"
- Achieves an average accuracy of ~90.20%.

## ⚙️ Rule-Based Risk Scoring System

- Each patient’s input is evaluated against known medical thresholds.
- Every abnormal feature adds to a cumulative health risk score, which helps explain why the model made its prediction.

### Scoring Logic
- age > 50 →       +1 point (Older age)
- cp ≥ 2 →         +1 point (Abnormal chest pain: non-anginal/asymptomatic)
- trestbps > 140 → +2 points (High resting blood pressure)
- chol > 240 →     +2 points (High cholesterol)
- fbs == 1 →       +1 point (High fasting blood sugar)
- restecg != 0 →   +1 point (Abnormal ECG result)
- thalach < 130 →  +2 points (Low max heart rate achieved)
- exang == 1 →     +2 points (Exercise-induced angina)
- oldpeak > 1.5 →  +2 points (Significant ST depression)
- slope == 2 →     +1 point (Downsloping ST segment)
- ca ≥ 1 →         +2 points (Major vessels affected)
- thal != 0 →      +2 points (Abnormal thalassemia)

---

### 💡 Score Interpretation
- 0–3 → 🟢 Low Risk: Heart appears healthy.
- 4–7 → 🟡 Moderate Risk: Maintain lifestyle; consider a routine check-up.
- ≥8 → 🔴 High Risk: Consult a cardiologist immediately.


- Returns a clear **prediction** (Heart Disease / No Heart Disease) with **confidence score of 90.20%**
- Built using a lightweight and scalable **FastAPI backend**
